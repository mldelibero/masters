\section {History of Capacitors}
\subsection{Leyden Jar}
Capacitors have their origins in the Leyden jar; developed by Ewald Jrgen von Kleist in 1745 and independently by Pieter van Musschenbroek in 1746. \cite{ieee_hist}

The Leyden jar was typically made from a glass jar with metal sheets spread on the inside and outside. Electricity could be stored by charging the jar with an electrostatic device and the removing the jar. This breakthrough in the study of electricity was exremely important to scientists, as it allowed electricity to be stored and then used later.
\cite{ieee_hist} 
---
The most common design for the Leyden jar was to use a glass jar with metal foil lining the inside and out. Then inner surface was typically charged via an electrostatic generator, while the outer surface was connected to ground. The charge would stay on the metal foil untill a short or small resistance was connected between them. Charge could be stored this way, allowing scientists, and showmen, to use greater amount of charge than they could generate at any one moment.

"At this stage, the pursuit of electrical knowledge was restricted by the limited amount of eletricity experimenters could atually generate."
\cite{empLight}

"First solution to storing electricity."
---
The discovery of the Leyden jar allowed scientists to store elecricity for the first time. \cite{wws_hist}

\subsection{Misc}
In 1872, the standard unit of measurement of a capacitor's capcitance was set to be the Farad. \cite{ieee_hist} 

In the 1950s, Bell labs began to popularize the transistor, which allowed circuits to become smaller and deal with lower voltages. This also lead to the development of smaller capacitors. \cite[f.~12]{dumInv}

Birth of some capacitors:

        Ceramic capacitors are completely inert; which means that they will not deteriorate under normal operating conditions.\cite[f.~45-46]{dumInv}

        The first glass dielectric capacitor was, in fact, the Leyden jar. While this early capacitor was used mainly for scientific experiments, commercial glass capacitors came later. 

        Glass tubular capacitors appeared in 1904 and were used in Marconi's experiments in wireless transmission. They were know as Moscicki tubes. They continued to be used in wireless communication until about WWI. \cite[p.~102]{dumInv}

                \item best ceramic mixture, steatite-$Ti0_2$:
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item near zero tempco
                    \item $\epsilon _r = [15,20]$

            \end{enumerate}

            1926 -- titanium dioxide (rutile) became available.\cite{deis_hist}

\subsection{Barium-Titanate Capacitors} \nocite{histFerr}
    \subsubsection{History}
        A ceramic composition wth barium titanate (BaTiO3) was first discovered in 1941. Barium titanate was quickly found to be able to exhibit a dielectric constant over 1000; an order of magnitude greater the best at this time (rutile - Ti02). It was not until 1947, that barium titanate appeared in its first commercial device, phonograph pickups.\cite{piezCer}

        "Barium titanate ceramics were discovered by E. Wainer and N. Saloman in the USA in 1942., by T. Ogawa in Japan in 1944, and by B. M. Vul in the soviet Union in 1944. All discoveries were and independently with no communication between the researchers because of World War II."\cite{hist_cerFilt}

    \subsubsection{Ferroelectricity}
        "The discovery of ferroelectricty in barium titanate in the 1940s made available for ceramic capacitor design dielectric constants up to 2 orders of magnitude greater than previously known."
        \cite[Ch 3 Sec III]{cerMaterials}

        Preexisting dipoles can be accurately predicted in ferroelectric materials' crystal structure. They create regions of uniform polarization called domains. The crystal symmetry of the dielectric determines the relative orientation between domains.

        These domains can be forced into a particular orientation by an externally applied electric field. "The effect of which is to increase the component of polarization in the field direction."

        Increasing DC bias represses domain reversibility and consequently decreases the low-signal ac dielectric constant.

        Increasing frequency decreases the dielectric constant through a 'relaxation' "centered in the GHz range." At this point the DF is maximal.
        \cite[Ch 3 Sec III]{cerMaterials}

    \subsubsection{MISC}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Barium Titanate ($BaTi0_3$) \cite[Ch 3 Sec IV.C]{cerMaterials}
            \item Most modern ceramic capacitor dielectric. In common use now.
            \item First published on in the US in 1942.
            \item Took over a decade before the industry put the material into active development.
            \item It is usually blended with other materials to get the desired effect.
        \item 1941 -- barium titanate became available (eps = 1000) \cite{deis_hist}
        \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Paper Capacitors}
    \subsubsection{Misc}
        Paper capacitors use waxed paper as a dielectric. They are primarily used in high voltage applications. But they are not preferred for much due to their high leakage and tolerances.\cite{learn_caps}

        1876 -- wax impregnated paper dielectric with foil electrodes \cite{deis_hist}
        -> power supply filtering in radios

        WWI spurred the development of radio. "It might be considered that this period (the early 1920s) saw the birth of the components industry.... Paper-dielectric capacitors were mainly tubular types enclosed in plain bakalizied cardboard tubes, with bitman or similar material sealing the ends." \cite[ch3]{dumInv}

        Paper capacitors were first patented in 1876 by Fitzgerald. \cite[ch.~11]{dumInv}

        During WW2, "waxed tubular paper-dielectric capacitors were replaced by metal-cased tubular types with rubber end seals. Metalized paper-dielectric capacitors were developed. \cite[ch.~3]{dumInv}

        Kraft paper capacitors typically had a dielectric constant of about 2-6 \cite[ch.~8.1]{poorIntro}

    \subsubsection{Impregnated Paper Capacitor}
        Paper is used as the dielectric. The paper is soaked with mineral oil to provide extra stability. The paper is interleaved with metal foil and then rolled to make the capacitor. \cite[ch.~8.2.1.1]{poorIntro}

\subsection{Lead Zirconate Capacitors}
    The discover of Lead Zirconate came directly from the study of Barium-Titanate.

\subsection{Tantalum Capacitors}
Tantalum capacitors are typically electrolytic and mostly have much better characteristics than aluminum electrolytic caps. There downside is a lower "maximum capacitance and and lower maximum working voltage."\cite{learn_caps}

    1956 - Tantalum solid electrolytic capacitor
    Transistors - spurred need for solid electrolytic capacitor (coupling or bypass) \cite[f.~56-64]{dumInv}

    Tantalum capacitors began to be commercially produced in the 1950s with the onset of the transistor. Bell labs patented the first solid-tantalum capacitor with Sprague pantenting the first comercially vaiable design in 1960. The solid tantalum capacitor presented a component which had a much higher capacitance per unit volume and greater reliablity than the market offerings at that time. \cite{charTant}

    Sprague released the first surface mount tantalum capacitor in the 1970s.\cite{spragueHist}

    Tantalum was designed to be a replacement for alumunim electrolytic capcitors in certain circumstances. It had a greater dielectric constant and was much more stable than aluminum. And with solid tantalum capacitors, the detriments of a liquid electrolyte went away. One of the historical main draw backs with tantalum capacitors has been the volatility in the supply chain. Short price spikes have repeatedly occurred in the market. When one such spike occurred around 1980, finer grain tantalum powders were created to acheive greater capacitance, in a smaller package with less overall tantalum. \cite[ch~3.1]{tantMis}

\subsection{Titanium Capacitors}

\subsection{Old Intro}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item glass (porcelein)
        \item Steatite ceramics

        Contained feldspar and were not as high loss as porcelein ceramics
        \item paper and mica 
        
        Were primarily used in first radio circuits on the early 1900s.
        They had very good loss characteristics, and could be manufactured into units with thin sheets (high capacitance, despite having a modest dielectric constant).
        \item Germany 1920 -- steatite ceramics that used alkaline earth oxide fluxes instead of alkaline oxide (feldspare)

        This gave them a low-loss characteristic.
        \item Extruded tubular steatite ceramic capacitors arrived and replaced mica
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Mica Capacitors}
During WWI, mica capacitors began to be produced in large quantities. This was mainly due to it being able to survive shock from weapons better than its glass counterpart. Also, it allowed the capacitors to be shrunk to achieve the same purpose. \cite[f.~37-41]{dumInv}

In light of mica supply chain problems and the emergence of ceramic capacitors during WW2, mica capacitors fell from prominence to a niche market after the second great war.\cite[Ch 3, Sec II]{cerMaterials}

Mica capacitors were originally made as a "clamped" style capacitor and used through the 1920s\cite{wiki_mica}. 

The mica capacitor was invented by M. Bauer in Germany in 1874. 

Mica capacitors are used as an extremely reliable and efficient option due to mica's inherent inertness and stability. \cite{tedds_mica}    
--
"Mica is very stable electrically, mechanically, and chemically. $\epsilon$ ~= [5-7].\cite{uiowa_mica}"

Mica capacitors have a very low tempco, change little with voltage, high Q, low ELS, and vary little with frequency. Used in RF a lot. On the downside, they are large. (You can used ceramics as a replacement). Most mica capacitors have low values (in the nF range).\cite{uiowa_mica}

\nocite{hh_cap_table}
\nocite{capGuide_mica}

Mica capacitors tend to provide very good results. They provide a choice which has high accuracy, a low temco, low variations of capacitance with voltage, and high Q. There main drawback is that they tend to be available only in lower capacitance ranges. They are know to jump in value on some occasions???? 
\cite{radio_mica}

The mica dielectric "was also one of the first dielectric materials to be used for capacitors in the early days of wireless because of its combination of stability and general physical and mechanical stability." Mica capacitors age slowly due to mica's natural inertness (it reacts with very little).\cite{radio_mica}

\subsubsection{Silver Mica Capacitors}

Tight tolerance (<=1\%),really good tempco and stability, but low capacitance values and expensive. Used in high frequency circuits a lot.\cite{learn_caps}

\subsection{Aluminum Capacitors}

Aluminum capacitors typically come in up to 50mF, but have high leakage currents, large tolerances, and large temperature coefficients. \cite{learn_caps}

\subsection{Polyester Capacitors}

Polyester capacitors provide an option for a cheap, high capacitance per unit volume option. On the downside, they have a high temperature coefficient. \cite{learn_caps}

\subsection{Polypropylne Capacitors}

Polypropylene capacitors can come up to a high working voltage of up to at least 3kV. They also can be used as a replacement to polyester capacitors due to their tight (1\%) tolerances.\cite{learn_caps}

\subsection{Polystyrene Capacitors}

Polystyrene capacitors have a high isolation resistance, but they also have a high ESL and exhibit a permanent value change if they get above 70C.
\cite{learn_caps}

\subsection{Polycarbonate Capcitors}

Polycarbonate capcitors have descent temperature coeficients, but bad tolerance.  \cite{learn_caps}

\subsection{Film}

"Traditional film capacitors were only available in modest sizes, <10uF."

Longer lifespans when compared to electrolytics.
