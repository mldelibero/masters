\section{Todo}

\subsection{Misc}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Put all acronyms on the acronym list
    \item Update tab on first paragraph in sections.
    \item Spell check all files.
    \item Get rid of all LaTex warnings.
    \item Put date instead of TBD on title page.
    \item Combine TOF and TOT onto same page.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MATLAB}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Combine iteration scripts into a single unit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What model is best suited for titanium electrolytic capacitors?
    \item Update the phase axis on the capacitor impedance figure.
    \item Add nodes to models.
    \item Add angle marker to loss tangent image.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Regression}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Include some discussion on J. Miller's modeling techniques for supercapacitors.
    \item Either add more models or don't say that you will in the intro
    \item Look at the LSE + Iteration plot before the modeling plot. Its magnitude error looks too good.
    \item Levy + err figures have 3 figures in a row and split a sentence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schematic Explanation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create a flow chart for the schematic.
    \item Plot the safe operating area with Matlab.
    \item Talk about why this phase measurement technique was chosen over others and their comparable accuracy.
    \item Expand explanation on the current booster.
\end{itemize}
