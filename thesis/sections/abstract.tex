This thesis suggests a theoretical approach for characterizing capacitors at up to a 500VDC bias. A circuit design was developed that allows a user to characterize a capacitor via discharge curves and a swept frequency anaylsis of the impedance. An iterative, regression analysis is explored and then applied to capacitor modeling.
