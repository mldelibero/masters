\subsection{Previous Abstract}
This paper presents an analysis of capacitor performance at up to 600VDC bias. The analysis is accomplished through small-signal impedance testing, charge and discharge time constant measurements, and leakage current measurements. All tests are recorded by means of multiple ADCs and computer analysis.

\subsection{Current Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}
This paper presents an analysis of capacitor performance degradation at up to a 600VDC bias. It proposes a testing method through small-signal impedance testing, charge and discharge time constant measurements, and leakage current measurements. Circuit analysis and initial prototypes will be discussed.
