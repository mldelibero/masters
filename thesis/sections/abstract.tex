\subsection{Previous Abstract}
This paper presents an analysis of capacitor performance at up to 600VDC bias. The analysis is accomplished through small-signal impedance testing, charge and discharge time constant measurements, and leakage current measurements. All tests are recorded by means of multiple ADCs and computer analysis.

\subsection{Current Abstract}
This paper presents an analysis of capacitor performance degredation at up to a 600VDC bias. It proposes a testing method through small-signal impedance testing, charge and discharge time constant measurements, and leakage current measurements. Circuit analysis and itinial prototypes will be discussed.
