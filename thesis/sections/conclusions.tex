\section {Conclusion}

In conclusion, the circuitry devolped in this thesis, along with the regression analysis developed, shows a promising ability to accurately model capacitors. The method shown provides the ability to model a capacitor over a 0->500VDC bias and a 100Hz->100kHz range. The regression analysis provides a means to compare new capacitors with unknown characteristics. The accuracy of the model is mostly determined by the number of parameters and typically has the greatest relative error near resonance.
