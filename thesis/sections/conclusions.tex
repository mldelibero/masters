\section {Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, the circuitry devolved in this thesis, along with the regression analysis developed, shows a promising ability to accurately model capacitors. The method shown provides the ability to model a capacitor over a 0 $\rightarrow$ 500VDC bias and a 100Hz $\rightarrow$ 100kHz range. The regression analysis provides a means to compare new capacitors with unknown characteristics. The accuracy of the model is mostly determined by the number of parameters and typically has the greatest relative error near resonance. Outside of resonance and low frequencies, the accuracy of the fit stays within $2 \Omega$ and $2^{\circ}$. The relative error, outside of a single peak in the phase plot, stays well below $5\%$.
