\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This thesis presents a method to automate capacitor characterization in order to determine the physical differences between large numbers of research grade capacitors. It focuses on measuring capacitor characteristics through swept frequency analysis and discharge curve measurements in the presence of up to a $500V$ DC bias. The method then generates values for the physical parameters of the capacitors by fitting a model to the empirical data by applying a regression analysis.
