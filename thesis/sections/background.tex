\section {Background}

The following is a list of the questions that I will be answering in my background section.

\begin {enumerate}
    \item Where are capacitors used with a high DC bias?
    \begin {enumerate}
        \item What characteristics are the most important there?
        \item What are the main failure modes?
        \item What are the current specifications of the parts in use now?
        \item What research is being done to develope better capacitors for this use case?
        \item How do they currently evaluate the capacitors?
        \item How would they benefit from my research?
    \end {enumerate}
    \item What is the state of the art in capacitance measurement?
    \begin {enumerate}
        \item Impedance analyzers
        \item Capacitance bridges
        \item Hi pot testers
        \item What are the good and bad points of each of these technologies?
        \item Why do they not solve the problem that I stated? 
        \item Why does this technology not currently exist?
    \end {enumerate}
    \item What work has been done similar to this in the past?
    \item What are the important characteristics of capacitors?
    \item Is there any evidence that a capacitor's properties will change over DC bias?
\end {enumerate}
