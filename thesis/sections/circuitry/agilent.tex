\subsection{Comparison with Agilent 4294A}

Even though the individual capabilities of the circuit described in this section are available in other meters, their combination for this application is unique. For instance, the Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer has the ability to measure a capacitor's impedance at up to 100MHz with a basic accuracy of $0.08\%$ \cite{agilent_4294A}. Also, with the 16065A attachment, it has the ability to measure these parameters at a 200V bias \cite{agilent_16065A}. The main advantages of this circuit is that it can measure with a 500V bias and it can measure discharge curves.
