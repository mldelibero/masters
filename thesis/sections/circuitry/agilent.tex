\subsection{Comparison with Agilent 4294A}

There are various instrumentation units on the market that provide a similar function as the circuit described in this section. For instance, the Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer has the ability to measure a capacitor's impedance at a greater frequency range and with a basic accuracy of $0.08\%$ \cite{agilent_4294A}. Also, with the 16065A attachement, it has the ability to measure these parameters at up to a 200V bias \cite{agilent_16065A}, as opposed to the 500V capability in this circuit. The other main disadvantage of the Agilent meter is that it does not provide the ability to measure discharge curves. As stated in Section: \ref{sec:regDis}, this characteristic is important in determining the capacitor's ability to deliver power.
