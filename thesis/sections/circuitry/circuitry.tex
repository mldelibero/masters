\section {Measurement Circuitry}
\label{sec:measCirc}
This section describes the schematic design, see Appendix: \ref{app:schematic}, used to meet the goals set out in the \nameref{sec:abstract}. At the time of this writing, this circuit has not been constructed, so what follows will be a theoretical explaination of the circuit's operation.

The purpose of this circuit is to measure the response of a capacitor to various test inputs in order to generate a model (Section: \ref{sec:regression}). This method will allow an analysis of the effect of the DC bias on the output model.
