\section {Measurement Circuitry}
\label{sec:measCirc}
This section describes the schematic design used to meet the goals set out in the Abstract (Section: \ref{sec:abstract}). The schematic can be found in the Appendix: \ref{app:schematic}. At the time of this writing, this circuit has not been constructed, so what follows will be a theoretical explaination of the circuit's operation.
