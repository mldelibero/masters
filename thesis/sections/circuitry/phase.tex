\subsection{Phase}

This section explains the circuitry used to measure the phase difference between the input voltage and the output current. This measurement, combined with the magnitude measurement, will allow for a complete impedance measurement at each frequency step of a test. The comparator circuit is configured as a sine to square wave converter. The two square wave signals will be fed directly into a timer input of the MCU. The MCU will measure the time between the two signals to determine their phase difference.
