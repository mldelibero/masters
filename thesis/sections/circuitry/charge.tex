\subsection{Charge}

This section of the circuitry is meant as a preperation stage for the other tests. 
It operates by setting the current measurement to High, closing the Charging Relay (LS4), and then ramping the DC Bias voltage with the high current measurement stage open. LS4 can be opened or left closed, dependent on the needs of the test.
