\subsection{Charging Circuitry}
\label{sec:charging}

This section describes the DUT charging circuitry seen in Schematic Page: 5. This part of the circuitry is meant to only be used to prepare the DUT for a test. The current is purposely limited in order to minimize the load on the SRS-PS350. The charging operation functions by enabling the high-current measurement and charging relays, and then slowly ramping the DC bias voltage until the DUT is fully charged.
