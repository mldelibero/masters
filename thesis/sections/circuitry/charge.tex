\subsection{Charging Circuitry}
\label{sec:charging}

The \gls{dut} charging \hyperlink{sch:discharging}{circuitry} is meant to only be used to prepare the \gls{dut} for a test. The current is purposely limited in order to minimize the load on the SRS-PS350. The charging operation functions by enabling the high-current measurement and charging relays, and then slowly ramping the DC bias voltage until the \gls{dut} is fully charged.
