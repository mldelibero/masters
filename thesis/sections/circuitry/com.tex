\subsection{Communications}

This section will describe the circuitry used to communicate to off-board processors.

\subsubsection{USB}
The USB section is used to communicate with a PC for data logging and post processing. This circuitry centers around a FTDI FT232H serial to USB chip. It allows seamless USB communication to a PC's com port with the MCU only needing to use a UART port. This significantly lowers the complexity of the communication bus, as the MCU is not responsible for running the USB stack.

\subsubsection{RS-232}
The board also has two, bidirectional RS-232 ports. They are able to be used for general purposes, but will most often be used for communicating with a sine-wave generator and the DC Bias supply.
