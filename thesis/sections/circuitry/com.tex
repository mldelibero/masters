\subsection{Communications}

The communications \hyperlink{sch:com}{circuitry} is used to communicate to off-board processors.

\subsubsection{USB}
The \gls{usb} section is used to communicate with a PC for data logging and post processing. This circuitry centers around a FTDI FT232H serial to \gls{usb} chip. It allows seamless \gls{usb} communication to a PC's COM port with the \gls{mcu} only using a single UART port. This significantly lowers the complexity of the communication bus, as the \gls{mcu} is not responsible for running the \gls{usb} stack.

\subsubsection{RS-232}
The board also has two, bidirectional RS-232 ports. They are able to be used for general purposes, but will most often be used for communicating with a sine-wave generator and the DC Bias supply.
