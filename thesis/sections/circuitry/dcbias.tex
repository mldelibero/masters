\subsection {DC Bias}
\label{sec:dcBias}

The DC bias control \hyperlink{sch:dcBias}{circuitry} controls a Stanford Research Supply SRS-PS350 power supply to generate the bias voltage for the circuit. Some of the models of this supply provide a serial input which can be used to set their output voltage. This scenario is preferred and the communications for it are handled through the RS232 transceiver found on Schematic Page: 3. Other models of this supply only provide an analog input option to control their output voltage. The specifications for this method are shown in Table: \ref{table:srsCtrl_table}. The control signal is generated by using the microcontroller to set the \gls{dac} output over a SPI bus. It is then buffered and clamped to under 1.5V. Since the SRS-PS350 has a gain of 500, this clamps its output to 750VDC. The circuit is only designed to operate at up to 500VDC, but this value is still within the specified ratings of the components in the signal path.

\input{tables/srsCtrl}

The \gls{dac} has a 2.5V internal reference with a 14 bit resolution, giving the control signal an ideal resolution of $150\mu V$ and the SRS-PS350 an ideal output resolution of $76mV$. The update rate of this device is not important to this application because the \gls{dac} will be set infrequently and only when the system is not actively collecting data.

If different characteristics are needed, the SRS-PS350 can be exchanged for an alternate power supply, but the control logic may not be supported.
