\subsection{Current Measurement}
\label{sec:iMeas}

In light of the high DC bias voltage present in the system, the current measurement \hyperlink{sch:discharging}{circuitry} utilizes a low-side current measurement technique. This allows the measurement electronics to operate at relative low (5VDC) voltages while measuring current from the \gls{dut} with a DC voltage in the 100s of volts.

\input{tables/imeas}

The current measurement circuit utilizes a transimpedance amplifier designed from the reference circuit in \cite{steve_thesis}. It utilizes three switched, feedback stages to measure nine decades of current (See Table: \ref{table:imeas_table}). The circuit operates by creating a virtual ground at the negative terminal of the \gls{dut}, and then directing the current through one of its feedback paths. The resultant voltage in Equation: \eqref{equ:trans} is then filtered and sent to the next stage for further signal conditioning.

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:trans}
Vo = I*R_f
\end{equation}

The AD817 op-amp has the precision and bandwidth needed to operate in a transimpedance amplifier configuration, but does not have the required drive strength for the  high current range. This limitation is overcome by inserting a BJT based current booster in the feedback path. This preserves the benefits of the op-amp, while providing the ability to drive a high-current signal.
