\subsection {Power}
The power supply section, shown on page 1 of the schematic, shows the complete power generation scheme for the circuit board. 24VDC is fused and then fed through an EMC compliance filter \cite{5VswitchDatasheet}. The initial fuse value is set to roughly twice the current rating of the switching power supplies. Once a practical current draw value is obtained, this value can be decreased. The resistors on the output of the 2 switching regulators are there to ensure that the minimum load (10\%) for the power supplies is met. The supplies require this in order to meet their regulation specifications. All of the power supplies where chosen such that their power atings were at least twice the maximum, expected load. The power supply generating $\pm 15V_{ISO}$ is slightly different than the rest, as its output ground is attached to the DC bias voltage instead of signal ground. This purpose of this seen in the optocoupler circuitry described in Section: \ref{sec:opto}.
