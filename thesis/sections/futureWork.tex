\section {Future Work}

This section will describe the future work needed to be accomplished in order to complete and further the stated goals of this thesis. It will mostly focus on the practical circuitry implementation and other aspects needed to make it a viable tool.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase the available frequency range for the measuerment circuitry.
    \item Add additional failsafe protection to the circuit.
    \item Update the regression technique for better accuracy (See Section: \ref{app:adtl_regression}).
\end{itemize}
