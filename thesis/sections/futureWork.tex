\begin{itemize}
    \item Build the circuit and validate against the stated capabilities and accuracy.
    \item Increase the available frequency range for the measurement circuitry.
    \item Add additional fail-safe protection to the circuit.
    \item Update the regression technique for better accuracy\ifisPPT \else~(See Section: \ref{app:adtl_regression})\fi.
    \item Evaluate the accuracy of the six term model\ifisPPT \else described in Section: \ref{sec:regression} with actual data\fi.
\end{itemize}
