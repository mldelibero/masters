\section {Future Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}

This section will describe the future work that needs to be accomplished in order to complete and further the stated goals of this thesis. It will focus on the practical circuitry implementation and other aspects needed to make it a viable tool.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Build the circuit and validate against the stated capabilities and accuracy.
    \item Increase the available frequency range for the measurement circuitry.
    \item Add additional fail-safe protection to the circuit.
    \item Update the regression technique for better accuracy (See Section: \ref{app:adtl_regression}).
    \item Evaluate the accuracy of the six term model described in Section: \ref{sec:regression} with empirical data.
\end{itemize}
