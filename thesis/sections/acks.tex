I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Dr. Merat, for his support and instruction in helping me complete this work. I would also like to thank Dr. Welsch and ARPA-E, who's leadership and funding under ARPA-E contract DE--AR000016 made this work possible. Furthermore, I would like to thank Steven Ehret, who's initial work on this contract enabled my own.
